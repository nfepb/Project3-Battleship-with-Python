**********************************************

Welcome admiral! This is a game of battleship.
The objective is to win the battle by finding
and sinking all the ennemy's ships.
You have 20 tries to sink the 5 ennemy ships before they overrun you.

Legend:
"_" = empty space
"O" = empty location hit
"X" = part of ship that was hit

Good luck admiral!
