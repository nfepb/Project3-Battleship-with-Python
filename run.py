Welcome admiral! This is a game of battleship.
The objective is to win the battle by finding 
and sinking all the ennemy's ships.
You have 50 tries to sink the ennemy fleet before they overrun you.

Legend:
"." = empty space
"O" = empty location hit
"@" = part of ship on player game board
"X" = part of ship that was hit

Good luck admiral! \n
